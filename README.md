#Built as a submission for Hydrangea Hacks 2021

###Inspiration
We were inspired to make a game that could help others, especially in these uncertain and stressful times. Many projects are geared towards helping people connect with other people, so we decided to make a project that could help anyone connect with someone that will never leave their side: ourselves. The game helps guide the user to do some self-reflection on the good and bad events of their day through art, and the game interprets the picture to create something new that can help the user see that all these different feelings are okay, and that we can make something beautiful out of them like the art that we made in the game. You don't need to be an artist to use our app, just ready to be open-minded and to see the big picture.

###What it does
It starts off very simple, gives instructions and prompts the user to play a little game where they reflect on their day by painting in our game. The user can build up points every time they open the game, and this changes the UI to make it more colourful and diverse. Eventually, if the user builds up enough points, the name of the game will even change from "Your World" to "Our World". This is to represent how the more we learn about ourselves and come to empathize ourselves, the more we can empathize others and build community. We do this to try to help others take a step towards becoming more open-minded, so that "our world" isn't just "my world".

###How we built it
We used PyGame and Replit! In addition, we used Canva to make the logos, and the Deep Dream API to generate a new image off of what the user drew in the painting game.

###Challenges we ran into
We were all very new to coding. We only had basic experience in Python and none of us had even used PyGame. In addition, we wanted to incorporate machine learning, which required a lot of research on our part and we were pressed for time.

###Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how much we learned in such a short period of time, despite being not experienced with coding. Not only that, we managed to relate every element of our game to something significant that helped guide the user through a process that we deem to be vital. We are also proud of our brainstorming process and our teamwork.

###What we learned
We learned how to use PyGame, and many different machine learning APIs, even if we did not use all of them. We also brushed up on our coding skills a lot.

###What's next for Our World
We plan on making more games to help the user be more open-minded. Our next focus will be to create more self-reflection games and also games that help combat the stereotypes that many of us are conditioned to believe. We plan on cleaning up the game a bit too, and to make it more interactive.
